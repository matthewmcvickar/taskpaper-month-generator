# TaskPaper Month Generator

**Use it here: [matthewmcvickar.github.io/taskpaper-month-generator](http://matthewmcvickar.github.io/taskpaper-month-generator)**

Given a list of tasks, generates a list of days and tasks for a specified month that can be pasted into TaskPaper for a monthly schedule.

For use with [Taskpaper Tiles](https://github.com/matthewmcvickar/taskpapertiles), my [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper)-based productivity framework.


## Instructions

Go to the **[TaskPaper Month Generator](http://matthewmcvickar.github.io/taskpaper-month-generator)**.

**To add tasks to a day**, enter the day number, start a new line, and list each new task on a new line, like you would in TaskPaper. Start a new line and press `Tab` to start an indented note.

**Events that repeat on a given day each week** can be listed under their day name, and the formatting is flexible: `Monday` and `Mondays` and `monday` and `mon` all work just fine.

**Events that happen on the last day of the month** can be listed under the heading `last` or `Last` or `Last Day` or `final` or `Final`.

The expected syntax is relatively forgiving. You can omit the colons after day names and you can omit the dashes before tasks, and it will still work.

### Example

This syntax is inconsistent to demonstrate its flexibility:

```
1:
- to-do item

14:
- another task
  notes

29
task
yet another task
  notes and details
  another note

Monday:
- a weekly task

wed
a task that happens every wednesday

last:
- a task that happens on the last day of the month
```

The generated TaskPaper month will be updated as you type. Hit the **Copy** button in the generated month box to copy it all to your clipboard, then paste it into a Taskpaper document.

To generate an empty month, click the **Empty** button in the editor.


## Nifty Features

- The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key works in the editor, to allow for notes.
- Generates a link to generate the next month at the end of the list.
- Quick copy-to-clipboard button.
- Utilizes local storage so that your list of monthly tasks is retained between visits.
- Syntax for tasks that occur weekly on a given day.
- Syntax for tasks on the last day of the month.
